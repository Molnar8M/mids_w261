    "_Think about what would happen if you replaced `'alice'` with `'*'` in the call to `pWordCount.sh` above? Does this behavior make sense for a word counting application?_ For HW1.3 you'll modify the `pWordCount.sh` script in HW1.2 and write a new `mapper.py` & `reducer.py` so that your modified script can perform WordCount on multiple words at a time. Passing `'*'` to your modified script should yield a tab separatated list of all words and their counts. When designing your modifications, __don't forget to add a sort component to your MapReduce framework and leverage the sort order in your reducer (i.e., there will be no need for a sort in reducer.py).__ You may wish to refer to this [notebook](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/dl.dropbox.com/s/5zq0faibmvtjlbr/DivideAndConquer2-python-Plus-CmdLine.ipynb), or video section 1.12.1 1.12.1 Poor Man's MapReduce Using Command Line (Part 2) located at: \n",

    "   \n",
    "* Your new mapper.py counts all occurrences of each word in the line.\n",
    "* In the `pWordCount.sh`, please insert a sort command to collate the output key-value pair records by key from the mappers. E.g., sort -k1,1. Use \"man sort\" to learn more about Unix sorts.\n",
    "* Your new reducer.py sums the count value from the collated records for each  word. There should be no sort in the reducer.py\n",
    "\n",
    "Your final output should match the output from __HW1.1.1__ (may vary a bit from the sample below)."
